# Synthetic Image Detection Benchmark

This project is a framework for benchmarking several state-of-the-art synthetic image detection models.

## Installation

## Install dependecies 

Create a new environment named `pytorch_env`:

```bash
conda create --name pytorch_env python=3.11
conda activate pytorch_env
```

and then install pytorch dependecies 

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

> **Note** :sparkles:: This framework has been **tested** with Python version `3.11.7` and PyTorch `2.1.2`. However, it **should work** with other versions as well. Please ensure that your PyTorch version is **greater than 2.0**. :warning:

Install additional dependencies 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the Dire model, mpi4py is required. You can install it using Conda with the following command:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py mpich
```


## Integrated Models

The following models have been integrated. Note that for some of these models, there are multiple pretrained instances, trained on different images generated by various generative models such as ProGAN, StyleGAN, and Latent Diffusion, etc.

## Usage

### Run model on a single image

### Run model on multiple images 

### Evaluate on a dataset

This produces and saves several evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, average precision, and confusion matrix.
